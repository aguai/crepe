CREPE Pitch Tracker [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/marl/crepe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/marl/crepe)
===================

CREPE is a monophonic pitch tracker based on a deep convolutional neural network operating directly on the time-domain waveform input. CREPE is state-of-the-art (as of early 2018), outperfoming popular pitch trackers such as pYIN and SWIPE:

We kindly request that academic publications making use of CREPE cite the aforementioned paper.


## Using CREPE

CREPE requires a few Python dependencies as specified in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt). To install them, run the following command in your Python environment:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This repository includes a pre-trained version of the CREPE model for easy use. To estimate the pitch of `audio_file.wav`, run:

```bash
$ python crepe.py audio_file.wav
```

then, the resulting `audio_file.f0.csv` contains the predicted fundamental frequency, along with the confidence on the presence of voicing, is produced for each 10-millisecond frame. 

    # time,frequency,confidence
    0.00,185.616,0.907112
    0.01,186.764,0.844488
    0.02,188.356,0.798015
    0.03,190.610,0.746729
    0.04,192.952,0.771268
    0.05,195.191,0.859440
    0.06,196.541,0.864447
    0.07,197.809,0.827441
    0.08,199.678,0.775208
    ...

In addition, the script saves the salience representation -- the activations in the last layer in the neural network -- is saved as `audio_file.salience.png`. This is how a salience representation looks like for an excerpt of a male singing voice:

For more information on the usage, please refer to the help message:

```bash
$ python crepe.py --help
```


## Please Note

- The current version only supports WAV files as input.
- The model is trained on 16 kHz audio, and if the input audio has a different sample rate, it will be first resampled to 16 kHz using [resampy](https://github.com/bmcfee/resampy).
- While in principle the code should run with any Keras backend, it has only been tested with the TensorFlow backend. The model was trained using Keras 2.1.5 and TensorFlow 1.6.0.
- Prediction is significantly faster if Keras (and the corresponding backend) is configured to run on GPU.
- The provided model is trained using the following datasets, composed of vocal and instrumental audio, and is therefore expected to work best on this type of audio signals.
  - MIR-1K [1]
  - Bach10 [2]
  - RWC-Synth [3]
  - MedleyDB [4]
  - MDB-STEM-Synth [5]
  - NSynth [6]
